>>>>>>>LANGUAGE DESCRIPTION<<<<<<<
This language is called APLACA (A Programming Language Almost Called Alpaca).
The syntax of APLACA is as follows:

---OPERATORS---
Whitespace is mandatory //not yet, though

Arithmetic:
Addition: + x y
Subtraction: - x y
Multiplication: * x y
Division: / x y
Modulo: % x y
Exponent: ** x y

| x y - bitwise or
& x y - bitwise and
^ x y - bitwise xor

Relational:
=_= x y - equal to
=_< x y - less than or equal
<_< x y - less than
>_= x y - greater than or equal
>_> x y - greater than
>_< x y - not equal to

Logic:
&_& x y - and
|_| x y - or
!x - not


/*EVERYTHING BELOW THIS POINT IS NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED*/
Assignment:
var <- (exp)
example:
x <- (+ 9 5)

String concatenation:
# x y (where x and y are strings)

---DATA TYPES AND VARIABLES---
bool
int
long
float
double
char
string (char[])

):


---CONDITIONALS AND RECURSION---

if (=_= herpderp harpdarp){
	asdfkjasldfkj
}
fiif (hurrdurr){
	asdfkalsfk
}
fi{
	sakufgakjfhaskd
}

APLACA contains no iterative statements; recursion is used instead.

---FUNCTIONS---
ret_type func_name (param1 param2...) {

}


---INPUT/OUTPUT---
x <- (# in "hi")
out <- (+ x 5)

>>>>>>>RESOURCES AND TOOLS USED<<<<<<<
The APLACA interpreter makes use of Flex and Bison.

The following resources were referred to in the making of this project:

>>>>>>>TARGET PLATFORM<<<<<<<
APLACA interprets to C code, so it should be capable of running on any system which can run a C compiler such as GCC.

>>>>>>>KNOWN PROBLEMS<<<<<<<
Bugs:
-cockroach
-beetle
-grasshopper
-mosquito
-wasp

>>>>>>>MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION<<<<<<<
This text file was created using state-of-the-art Notepad technology.
